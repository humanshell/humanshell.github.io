title: What I Believe
---

I once read a post from a WordPress developer that not only made sense to me, but has convinced me to do the same. To create a single location to which I can point those inquisiting minds that always ask: "if you don't believe in God, then what do you believe?" I will return to this page to correct my outlook when I've decided it must be amended and endeavor to keep it as close to my current beliefs as possible. Therefore, at whatever point in the future you've finally arrived at this page, you can trust it reflects the latest version of my personal beliefs.

The Physicality of Natural Reality

A lot of what can be considered my "core beliefs," or what 95% of the world would call my "lack of faith," stems from my fascination with the physical and natural laws that govern our reality. Take for example that quaint little equation E = MC2. The beauty of this little gem stems from the fact that it so elegantly defines the relationship between the energy and matter that make up our universe. The equals sign indicates that matter and energy are the same thing. They can flow between forms and are either a product or quotient of the doubling of the constant speed of light. It's in ideas such as this that I find my faith lurking.

I have heard it argued that the beauty and simplicity of examples such as the one just described are the very evidence of gods existence. That because the true complexity of the universe that surrounds us can be expressed in such simple terms, there must exist a divine creator singularly capable of making this possible. I wholeheartedly disagree.

It seems sensible to me that the underlying fundamental forces that give rise to the physical universe stand squarely on their own merit.

Evolutionary Inheritance

I believe part of the illusion of a creator has been inherited as a biological trait inherent in our mode of procreation. Our parental lineage ingrains in us a difficulty in conceiving of an existence not preceded by the joining of a male and female. Think for a minute about the labels we place on the constructs we struggle to explain: Father Time, Mother Nature, God the Father, His Son, The Virgin Mother. Our linear experience of the passage of time places both paternal and maternal lenses between our understanding and the ultimate truth of existence.
