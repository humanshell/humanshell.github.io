I’m thinking of someone
you might know.

I’m thinking of someone
you must know.

Thinking long and hard
might bring you a clue.

If you’ve already figured it out
good for you.

But if you haven’t
don’t be in despair.

The person I’m thinking of
can’t even sit in a chair.

You see this person, every time
you look in the mirror.

That’s right this person lives
inside all of us

Don’t worry – you have nothing to fear
