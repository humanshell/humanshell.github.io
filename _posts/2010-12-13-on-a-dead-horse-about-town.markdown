People never cease to
amaze me

They come and they go
Slipping in and out

You blink and they’re gone
but when you really look
you can fond out what
they are all about.

If people were books
They’d read like the rain
Dripping with truth
but smelling of pain.

Easily written from imagination
They drowned in the waters
of immortal saturation

If all were lost today
0r tomorrow,
One would still read
and the rest
would still follow.
