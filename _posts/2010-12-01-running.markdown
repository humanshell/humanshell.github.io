As reality clenches tighter,
I can feel my breath slipping.
All I owe piles faster,
surpassing any conception of height. –

The weight of life increases,
In increments of exponential power.
Time begins to reveal less & less,
I feel I am standing still. –

Why must responsibility carry consequences,
when man must carry a gun.
Shooting blanks in the hunt for life,
death will have its revenge. –

After I close my eyes,
I can finally see.
Without light,
where would we be?
