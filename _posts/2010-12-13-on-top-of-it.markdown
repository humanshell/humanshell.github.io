Can you touch an empty space
is there something to be felt?
Does it have a consistency
like a deck of cards dealt.

Can you see a space unoccupied
does it exist at all,
can you stand in a place unoccupied
will you be surprised?

Donâ€™t ever feel you are alone
life brings occupants,
it has a way of selecting
those less dissident.

A lavatory of emotion
brings eerie feelings of accomplishment.
Pay attention to the facts
since belief brings astonishment.

Be blinded by thought
rather than emotion,
when all seems lost
revert to an earlier notion.
