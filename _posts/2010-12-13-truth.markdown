The water flows
The air blows –
The fire burns
and the earth churns –

Eyes Blink
Stomachs shrink –
Legs walk
and mouths talk –

This may all be true
Through and through

But imagine what it would mean
Inside of a dream

If everyone could imagine
Think of what would happen

If everything could happen
Think of who would imagine…
