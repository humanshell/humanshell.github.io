I am astonished by the many faces
which leave so many traces.

Can we remember the things we need
after the ticks of life recede?

Those who touch us deeply
will serve to deliver us freely.

Will you hold my hand
will you connect your electricity,
can you find it in you
to be my simplicity?

I washed up on shore
from a thought in the dark,
It ran from me so quickly
I had no choice but to disembark.

United we stand
divided we fall,
I hold in my hand
the answers to it all.
