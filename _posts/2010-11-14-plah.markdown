Feed the hunger with one hand,
Punch it with the other.
Without feeling we may all enjoy life,
Otherwise shut-up.

Throughout consciousness, faults are altered,
Torn by the overwhelming need to succeed.
Fight for luv, fight for honor,
But always remember what you’re fighting for!

Looking through the pale, smudged windshield
Of life – always try to find a clean spot.
Those of us who cannot, will be imprisoned,
indefinitely – requiring only a breath to survive.

Try, try, with all your might, for
Not trying at all is: failure.
Failing to achieve, failing to perceive,
It’s all the same in the game of life.

Always Remember
