The plural of the 2
wouldn’t that be 4?
In this world the solitude persists…
my back I feel against the floor.

If 2 wings can take you higher
what loft could you reach with 4?
Could you finally look down
on the oppressor,
Shouldn’t it bring the keys
to unlock the sky’s door?

Flowers will bloom
without a thought given to the score,
playing on a global field
yielding only to that which is in store.

Draped upon everything is life tasted by the poor,
It takes a sensitive pallet
to discern the fleeting delicacy
of what seems to have come
…BEFORE…
