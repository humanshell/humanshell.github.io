Holy shit.
what if we couldn’t
speak!
Could I talk in a voice
that means
retreat?
Or would the world
seem different,
in a silent void
that is reluctant
to reveal its yield?
How do you think?
Is it real?
Or can you feel
the presence that insists?
I may just be a twitch!
You son of a bitch
how dare you resist,
what if I wrote on a list,
that I was going to slit your wrist,
what if I tried to persist,
would you show interest?
What if it meant incest?
What if it all was a test?

Do you still think you’re blessed
