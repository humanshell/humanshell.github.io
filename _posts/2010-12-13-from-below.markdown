If I had the power
to perceive

I think I would find
it easier to believe.

It’s hard to think it
may all be true

That he loves me
and all of you.

Today and tomorrow
comes and goes

What is really happening?
No one knows!

I chose to believe
what I want to believe

Only cause I can’t
seem to perceive.
