To all who are listening
please understand…

We are all in trouble
we must make a stand.

Our grip is slipping
on all that we know

If we don’t fight and
fight hard
we’ll all be forced to let go.

A little more is taken each
and every day

If we all don’t watch it
we all will pay

Taking me lightly is
one way to see

What it would be like
to wish for the way
it used to be!
