If you can’t feel the rain
on your face,
then you’re all for not_

It falls in such a peaceful way
that you can’t deny,
what you’re taught_

The rings that run around our life
are a little bit constricting_

But only if you view them
from a seat that entitles you to be restricting_

Once these barriers are released
we have an opportunity_

To become a welcoming force
to the desires that allow us to be embraced_
