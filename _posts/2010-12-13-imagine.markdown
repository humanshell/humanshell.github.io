What if there were no mirrors
all reflections would bend and fold,
depending on consistency and
perception untold.

How could you tell
if you looked your best?
How would you put your comb, makeup
and cloths to the test?

Could you still find yourself
better than others,
wouldn’t it be harder to
find suitable lovers?

What if there were no mirrors
unable to look upon your face.
Not knowing the pain
of occupying your space.

Mirrors shed light on the
outside of what you consider
the inside.

would it be better to not see –
does it corrupt what we believe ourselves to be?
