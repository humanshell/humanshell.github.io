If there was only a way
you could be the one.

What if there was a channel
to watch all the needs of
the betrayed.

Would you watch?

Of course you would
how can you take your
eyes off pain?

Together at last – one with you
what do I mean…
all is lost without us two.

Coming down; the starts glisten
Not even knowing; who will listen.

Yet without doubt
they fill your eyes,
with a longing uncompromised

if they could tell what would they say?
