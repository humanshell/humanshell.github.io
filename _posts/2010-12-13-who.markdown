Out of darkness comes
enlightenment.

Could this be true?
What of the moment
when everything’s new?

Is there really a start
or an ending?
I see the light for
which my heart is mending.

Finding the path in the woods
means knowing the way –

are you listening?

No, you’re reading.
What becomes of the person
who knows…he only finds
fields of pain.
Longing for acceptance
what is left to gain.

I find myself dreaming of what will come
only to find that everything is done?
