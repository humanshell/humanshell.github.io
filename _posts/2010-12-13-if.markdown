Touch if,
grab if,
lick if,

Try to imagine a pliable universe
one that is changed by the touch.
If it were touched everyday
it would change, but could we tell how much?

What if it were touched everyday
by a multitude of actions?
Could you tell if it was true
could we provide the counteractions?

It’s a sense of completeness,
one with all,
but if it were to be
why must we crawl?

The infinite stares us in the face
it calls for a contradiction,
in a time that keeps with pace
it’s less of an affliction.
