Chuck Lorre has been writing for television shows for almost 40 years. All of his shows end with what he calls a "vanity card." They are short messages that are like blog posts that he's been writing since before blogs existed. Sometimes they're stories he makes up, other times it's just a thought he had earlier that week. Some are funny and some are sad; but every so often there's one that really makes you think. This weeks episode of [The Big Bang Theory](http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_bang_theory/) ended with a vanity card that I think speaks to everything I've been learning about in class: society, culture and how socialization affects who we are and how we see the world. I thought I'd share it with all of you...
