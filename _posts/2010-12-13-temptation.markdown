If you could listen with your eyes
what would you hear?

Do colors make noise
and is it clear?

What if a rose could say your name
would you want to listen?
Do you think it would sound the same?

A sight for sore eyes is a delightful thought
what if the sound of a branch
could be sought?

If the earth told you to leave
would you listen?
Or find the thought hard to
believe!

If I had the chance
I would talk to the sky,
asking questions
only answered by PI.

To find a way is sought by all
but walked by only a few on call.
