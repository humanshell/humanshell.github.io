The depths of perception
delve deeper into unconsciousness
Than any mere organism
could comprehend.

Perception overcomes all boundaries
to bring the world to us,
Still we cannot bring ourselves
to the world.

Even though perception can be
bent and shaped to our own desire,
Nobody bends it correctly.

I feel death is the bending of perception,
truly needed,
in the sad state if today's affairs.
