Every so often I find myself battling demons
That defy even my most structured comprehension.
Bouncing, feverishly, through: thought, time and space,
Religiously-ransacking any minute amount of reason.

I plead – ecstatically – for mercy, always loosing,
Due to over exhaustion, combined with temperament.
To truly understand these demons,
A man must be a god!

I will not lie, I have on occasion incorporated
Drugs to aid in my endless struggle.
From dawn till’ dusk I carry the overwhelming
Weight of a world to heavy for my shoulders.

Man’s struggle isn’t entirely in vein,
The lessons learned are unique and extreme,
In their own way. Characterizing each in his
Own way.

Do Not Retreat
