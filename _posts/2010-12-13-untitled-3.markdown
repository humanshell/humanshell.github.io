I’d like to go to a place
where no one is,
Where I can be alone
to live in harmony.

Feeling of pleasure
running from pain,
you must admit
I am to blame.

I could do without the hurt
and the shame,
still I wonder
where is the fame?

Give me love
and give me truth,
and I’ll show you a man
who will dilute.
