A better man I want to be
whenever I feel she thinks of me,
No games are played
only feelings conveyed…

The fire in her eyes is
the complex refraction of compassion,
And the calm in her voice could
sooth the most restless of hearts…

If I knew my maker, personally,
I would have to thank – him, “(her)”?
for blessing me with the burn for another.

Sometimes I wonder how it would be
to move through life with someone
other than just me.
