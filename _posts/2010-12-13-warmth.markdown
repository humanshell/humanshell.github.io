The light of belief
is a blinding sight,
I want to close my eyes
and I just might.

It’s a dreadful feeling
when you seem alone,
a freezing chill
that you can feel to the bone.

But think for a minute
and it seems more clear,
when no one’s around
you’re still near.

Be a friend to yourself
the best you can,
believing in yourself
is way better than god’s plan.

You are the one
the only one,
who will be there for you
and only you!

Be Your Greatest Fan
