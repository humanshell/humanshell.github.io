Space travel
grabs imagination
to fly amongst the stars
what an incredible infatuation.

In a geosynchronous orbit
alone, quiet and still
yet traversing the unknown.

Pure and clean
unknown by most
trapping all that resides
acting as a host.

I would leave all that I know
to traverse the unknown.
Living abroad in my own special way
I would call it my home.

It would fulfill all that I know
answering questions…

…in an instant it would be so
unknown destinations.
