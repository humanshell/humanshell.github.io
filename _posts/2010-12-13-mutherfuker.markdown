When you find yourself thinking
don’t limit the youth,
they possess all
that you would find uncouth.

You pay the fine
but it doesn’t go away,
I would rather be drowned
than a lawyer today.

Stop and look
at the boy in shambles
I hear the birds
they land and ramble.

Starting life, feels persistent
but what you find is rather
existent!

I feel I must be insistent
to the fact that those
who kill…

…should be stricken in an instant.
