Finding and feeling you learn your way,
never knowing how much you must pay.
To you it is a necessary step,
for others itâ€™s a fucking paycheck.

You sweat and you bleed,
always remembering what you need.
Never learning from your mistakes,
never knowing what it takes.

Always counting on what you got,
never really smoking enough Pot.
To some this is a Dream,
to others it is a Nightmare!

To those others, I invite U:

Never Stop Learning!
