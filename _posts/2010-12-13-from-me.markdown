I find myself alone
on a plane of existence,
everyone is close
but not as resistant.

It is sometimes disconcerting
how everyone lives.
But what else can you do
when thatâ€™s how it is?

Can one life make a difference
on all that we know?
Is it worth the journey
to try and show?

Am I special
please pardon me,
I find myself living
on a plane that is very high.

I believe I am worthy
of an enlightened position
seeing how I transcend
all cognition.

TO YOU
