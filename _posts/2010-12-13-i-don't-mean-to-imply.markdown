If we lived in a bed
there would be a sheet
that represents life
it almost seems neat.

If you really think about it
what lies could veil,
a truth so uncompromised
it fills the sail.

All must be difficult
in a world filled with vain,
when all could be simple
and untouched by disdain!

If the world was one
could we even survive,
with the mentality of a child
how can we thrive?

I touch the sky
why must I try,
I live in the lie
that it’s bad when we die.
