Patch the holes in your heart
with life lived extreme.
Indulgence and glamour feed fulfillment,
and place meaning on the word team.

Tenderness and caring will take you far
the leader of the pack is always in sight.
The downfall of man will come
in the willingness to fight.

All alone on the plane of existence,
topping the charts of immortal persistence.

Begging for touch and
killing for pain,
all breeds a sibling
riddled with disdain.

Around the sun and into
the lake, the circle
of life temps all
but fateâ€¦
