If there were no love –
- would there be no life,?
If there were no pain –
- would there be no death?

If there were no thoughts –
- would there be no sex,?
If there were no god –
- would there be anything?

From birth to death we wonder,
but do we ever really know.

Some men will travel from the
earth to the stars,
BUT
All men must travel from
life to death.
