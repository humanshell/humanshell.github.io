Strike the distance
in one way or another
it’s gone before you know it
make time for what you wonder.

Think about the time
you did what you wanted
and make sure you cherish
those that you taunted.

Friends and lovers are
really all the same.
When you’re unfaithful to either
you are the one to blame.

When it all comes down to it
the good will prevail.
All the honest and true
possess lives that sail.

When all seems lost and
you feel like you’re drowning,
just remember the day
you found all you were doubting.
