You can look to the future
just like you look to the past,
but the present
moves too fast.

Living in the moment
when then meets later,
you can’t help but wonder
is it working in your favor?

I can’t believe the moment
I just thought of,
Has already been caught
by the past’s eager glove.

Does the future know
that the past exists,
and once its there
does it continue to persist?

Maybe there is no present
only a hazy glow,
where time seems to slip
to and froe.
