Thinking about love
brings feelings unknown.
Unable to fathom
the connection that has grown.

- Seeing life around every corner –
- One knows nothing of the former –
- As each of them grow warmer –
- Everyday makes them older –

This seems evident
in every fold of time.
Untold stories of
those taken in their prime,

How can you find
what you’re looking for
when all that can be found
is what lies at the core?

An upwelling sensation of uplifting
remain
will bring you the seeds
needed to gain.
