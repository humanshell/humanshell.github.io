Out of the darkness
is where it’s from.

It resides in all,
but when will it come?

Does it lie in wait
for the perfect time?

Or rear it’s ugly head
when there’s need for a crime?

You can see it in shadows
and feel it in your heart.

Maybe it needs to be loved
maybe right from the start?

As soon as it comes
get out of the way

If you can’t control it
It could ruin your day!
