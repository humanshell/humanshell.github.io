Light travels through great darkness,
over many millennia.
Destined to be perceived by
eyes all over the universe.

Temptations are often drawn from words,
completing a great cosmic riddle.
While answers float rhythmically,
in and out of religious beliefs.

Fractioning off meaningless garble,
only serves to entice understanding.
Seen and experienced by few,
those who partake know not what they do.

Raging rivers of relief & romance,
deposit sentiments of love and hate.
Keeping the world divided through
godawful moments of pain and anxiety.
