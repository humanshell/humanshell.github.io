Your existence is eternal
why must you fight it?
If it weren’t for such a blessing
you wouldn’t even believe it.

Can you feel yourself living
it’s so much like a heartbeat
the thought seems simple
almost cemented in concrete.

Yet it slips like a bitch
right through your fingers
always believing
that its example lingers.

If it weren’t for the chaos
I would find something wrong.
If all were in order
it would last way to long.

Shuffle your life
like a deck of cards,
walk lightly and
take care in your dialogs.
