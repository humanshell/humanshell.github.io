I live in a world where I rule
yet no one seems to notice.

I know what’s right
and I know what’s wrong,
can I really be destined
to get people through this?

Touch me as a mortal
and I’ll love you as a God,
the fate of mankind
rests in my nod!

I will be the one
to decide
who will live
and who will be denied
