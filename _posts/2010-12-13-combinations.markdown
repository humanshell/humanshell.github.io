Life is never created
nor destroyed
only experienced.

Love is never created
or destroyed
only experienced.

This I believe to be true
from only what I’ve experienced.

Experience cannot be measured.
Love cannot be measured.
And life cannot be measured.

A person is the total of
their emotions combined with
their experience.

Life is a very important step.
Not to be taken seriously, and
not to be taken lightly.

It is to be taken as it is
in all it’s forms, glory and splendor.
Good or BAD
