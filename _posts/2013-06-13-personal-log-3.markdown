It's never too early & it's never too late, not to decide what your priority is, but to constantly reevaluate what your priority is. The trick lies in knowing that everyday you spend awake slightly alters your priorities and perceptions. Once you can acknowledge that, you're truly free to control your priorities instead of constantly trying to live by them.
