As I knock on the door of my future
I can hear no echo,
almost as if its empty,
I may have to let-go.

Riding the winds of change
can take you where you need to be,
but sailing the seas of yesterday
will never set you free.

Open your arms to adversity
and welcome it with love,
this will be your chance
to rise far, far above.

When something stands
to knock you down,
let it know with a push
that you wear the crown.
