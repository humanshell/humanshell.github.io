Time goes by leaving
it’s stench on the road.
All that falls once
again must grow.

I find my fist tensing again
before I sleep.
In my dreams they may come
rushing through my body down so deep.

Up, down, left, right all directions
I hear music,
although it comes and goes
it may be the only one that knows.

From the ocean to the soil
the sky touches all,
alcohol fuels most of the turmoil
and surely causes all to fall.

To touch life in the place it hurts
is everything’s dream.
