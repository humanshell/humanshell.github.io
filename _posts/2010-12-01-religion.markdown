We hope & pray, with hands clenched tight-
- waiting – for when the time is right.
- You place material means and value -
Usually all your finances will allow u,
Into the hand of your – god – and
Then you wonder why all you received was a nod – (?)

Frightened by god you run to his house
And hide behind your hands, as
You plead for forgiveness.
