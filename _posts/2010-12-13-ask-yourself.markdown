Touch the sky everyday
it’s the link to all,
without the sky who would we be
there would be no door to the stars.

If it were to be
I would shoot to the last known area
there I would answer questions unknown
those who don’t, have a nice time.

Look at me, what do you see
is it good, like it should be?
Can you see the pain, who could gain
I should try for a while
to see who is in denial.

A spot unseen to those unknown
I can be the understood onlooker
accepting it’s guest as a traveler
I could explore a region long sought after.

I would
I should
do you think you should?
Wait…
do you think you would?
