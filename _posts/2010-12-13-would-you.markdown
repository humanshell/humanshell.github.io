Look out for those
who choose to haunt you.
They are the ones
choosing to live without you.

It’s never worth the trouble
to find something too hard.
Try to keep it simple,
easier to play your card.

If life was a game of chances
the road would be more straight,
but if the game is fixed
you end up as the bait.

Turning your back on all that you know
leaves yourself open
for what may be in store.

If all were to end
tomorrow or be four
do you think you’d have the power
to continue to ignore?
