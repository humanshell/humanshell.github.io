Speak with a meaning
but don’t always mean what you say.
If I must believe
Then I guess I should pray.

As I speak to myself
I listen with care,
I know what I’m saying
It’s good to be aware.

Look down on others
for just one moment,
It gives a different perspective
on who’s really important.

People don’t like, everything different
I think they find it inefficient.
If all eyes were open, to the truth
It would be easier on the youth.

Sleep with caution
listen with care
keep your eyes open
and always stay aware.
