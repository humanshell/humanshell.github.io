Look around you
what do you see?
Is it real,
are you as happy as you can be?

If the things you touch
were to be gone,
would it be right,
or would it be wrong?

Changes are coming
like an unrelenting rain,
willing to wet
those with pain.

If under an umbrella
you choose to stand,
carefully consider
its not always as planned.
