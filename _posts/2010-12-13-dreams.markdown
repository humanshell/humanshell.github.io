Continue to use the tools you have
if it weren’t for the available
you couldn’t survive.

In black there exists
a trait to behold,
one point in space
that contains the new and the old.

Looking at existence
leaves life in a haze.
An overwhelming exhaustion
that is mastered with age.

I see eyes on the horizon
that blink with disdain.
How can so many be lost
and entangled in pain?

I sleep in a world
of comfort and truth
that contains both
wonder and amazement.
Fly With Me
