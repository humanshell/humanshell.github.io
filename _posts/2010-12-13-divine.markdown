God is looking down on all
of us…

Seeing all that goes on here
he must be pleased…

Somehow I find this
hard to believe…

I think it’s not me
but maybe I’m diseased…

You would think that a book written
by man,
would be hard to follow…

Yet wars have been fought
blood has been shed,
women and children slaughtered!

This just doesn’t seem
smart to me.
