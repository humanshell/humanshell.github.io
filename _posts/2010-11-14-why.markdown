Killing isn’t wrong, only perceived that way.
Fore it is human nature, to take from another.
Positions, love, money, -
Hold no value to instincts?

Finding another interesting is flattering,
Killing another is murder.
Perception can bend and shape, but
Only a human can truly kill.

To assume killing is wrong,
Is taught. But
To know killing is wrong,
Is divine.

Why must we conceive the idea,
When we don’t hold the right?
And is it not murder, to kill unknowingly,
When you were instructed all your life
To assume killing is wrong.
