The constant of change has persisted on
as I look back
I can barely see the peaks I once stood upon.

Friends and acquaintances have come and gone
some leaving an impression
but very few - relied upon.

Ideas and beliefs once held dear
have seemed to vanish,
some leaving behind confusion
in place of revelations they once made clear.

Volumes of questions persist unaltered
through life's twilight I lie awake,
causing the days to grow longer
and more and more awkward.

Trying to stay positive grows harder with each year
because - painfully - it's become apparent
knowledge can be susceptible to fear.

Surprised and disheartened I close my eyes
because looking at the state of affairs
proves god has been compromised.

When did we decide and who made the decision
that the taking of one life is justified
while the other deserves prison?

I will not stand in proud jubilation
until we no longer think of ourselves
as just a mere collection of nations.

Cowering behind walls of hand drawn borders
keeps us straddling the fence of extinction,
I fear this will continue
until we can think of ourselves first as humans.

When extinguishing the candles
on our cakes once a year
lets all wish the for the same
an existence that makes us proud to be here.
