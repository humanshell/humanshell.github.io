I would like to run
far into the night.
To a place
where darkness becomes light.

I would like to stand
upon a place so high.
Life would be forever love
thinking of all I’ve tried.

I would like to swim
from the earth to the moon.
Feeling in my heart
that the dawn cometh soon.

To whom does this seem wrong?
I challenge you to believe.
After all the sights are gone
all that’s left is what you need.
