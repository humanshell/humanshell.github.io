Take into account how you feel in the morning.
It could be the tell tale sign of how you sleep the
next night. Find something hard in everyday, and
then conquer it. Its so easy to speak to paper, it
listens like all is silent and only you matter. I think I
would enjoy living in a quiet corner where not much
happens, and I could be alone with my thoughts. I
already know I like to get drunk. There’s something
special and personal about being inebriated. It’s
almost a way of looking in on your self. Much can
be discovered from this point of view, but like all
points of view it cannot be the only one. For one
point of view is both sad and depressing, look at
everything from all angles and its way more
interesting. OK, I’m done with this page, thanks for
listening it helps control rage.
