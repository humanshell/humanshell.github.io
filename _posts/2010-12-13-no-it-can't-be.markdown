To find what you’re looking for
means looking for what you can’t find.
How many people truly believe
what you can’t see when you’re blind.

How can you believe in what you see,
when you’re blinded by the truth?
I say look for what cannot be,
and take your head out of the noose.

If it cannot be please try to believe,
why must you perceive when it’s so easy to leave?

Try to confirm what seems to be true,
and I bet you’ll find something soo new.

Ride the waves of lies
and crash into the rocks,
believe what it implies
and you’re no better than the cops.
