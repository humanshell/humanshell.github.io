Character Arrays in C","slug":"dynamic-character-arrays-in-c","markdown":"In my first Data Structures class I was assigned a project where I was required to gather input from a user and then operate on that input to evaluate a mathematical expression. While I was writing the program I discovered how to dynamically allocate memory for an array of characters input from stdin. While I ended up abandoning the technique becuase it wasn’t going to work in that specific project, I wanted to document it here so I wouldn’t forget about it and so that others could benefit from my small insight.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of writing C code has always been the challenge of crafting my code to be as small and efficient as possible. A large part of efficiency in a C program comes from intelligently managing how that program creates and handles its memory during execution. Gathering input from a user at the console presents a few challenges when it comes to memory management. How many characters will the user be allowed to enter? How do you warn your users about the limitations to their input? It can be wasteful to allocate memory for 255 characters if your users will only enter 10 or 50 or even 100.\n\nWe can mitigate these challenges by declaring a pointer to a character array and then initializing it with enough space to hold only a single character. By doing this we minimize the amount of memory needed when first compiling and running our program, and then simply resize it dynamically while the user is giving us their input.\n\nThe code is rather simple. I've created a single file program that I named `main.c`. It would probably make more sense in a larger program as a function that takes a character pointer as an argument and returns that pointer once it’s complete. Something like:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\nchar *get_user_input(char *input)\n```\n\nHere's the entire program:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\nint main(void) {\n  int i = 0;\n  char c, *input;\n  input = (char *) malloc(sizeof(char));\n\n  if(input == NULL) {\n    printf(\"Could not allocate memory!\");\n    exit(1);\n  }\n  \n  printf(\"Input a string, press enter when done: \");\n  \n  while((c = getchar()) != '\\n') {\n    realloc(input, (sizeof(char)));\n    input[i++] = c;\n  }\n\n  input[i] = '\\0';\n  printf(\"\\nYou entered the string: %s\\n\", input);\n}\n```\n\nIf you’d like to run this program for yourself, copy it into a file called `main.c` and run this command in your terminal:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\ngcc main.c -o main\n```\n\nWe start by declaring an int named `i`. It’s declared and initialized to 0 because its only function will be to serve as an index into our character array. Because we want to start inserting characters at the beginning, `i` needs to be 0. We also need two char variables, `c` will server as the temporary storage location where we can check its value to see if it should be inserted into the array or if the user is done entering their input. The `input` pointer will be the location where we dynamically allocate memory for the user’s input. Some programs might call this a \"buffer\" instead of input.\n\nThe `input` pointer is first initialized with just enough memory to store a single character. The reason for this is two-fold. First, we don’t want to allocate more memory than we need to. A single character is one of the smallest memory types we get from C. Secondly, all \"strings\" in C should be terminated by a [null character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character). A string in C is nothing more than a contiguous group of individual characters terminated by the null character. Also, by creating our initial character array with enough space for one character we are ensuring that after we’ve dynamically allocated enough space for the string entered by our user we have one spot left at the end for the NULL.\n\nThe call to [`malloc()`](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/2.13.html#malloc), which is how we dynamically initialize memory for a data type at runtime in C, is not guaranteed to return a valid pointer to a properly created memory location. So we next check to see if the input variable is pointing to NULL and if it is we bail out with an error. Once we know we have a pointer to a valid memory location we can ask our user for their input.\n\nAfter printing the request for input with [`printf()`](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/2.12.html#printf) we enter a [`while()`](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/1.6.html#while) loop which uses [`getchar()`](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/2.12.html#getchar) to grab each character entered by the user one by one. We check to see if it's equal to the newline character ('\\n') which indicates the user hit the enter or return key. This tells us that the user is done typing and we can move on past our while loop. If the character is anything besides a newline we want to store it in our array.\n\nThis is where the real magic of the C standard library comes into play. Using the [`realloc()`](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/2.13.html#realloc) function we can dynamically resize the memory space used by a data type at runtime. In our case we want to increase the size of the input array by enough to hold the character just entered by the user. This function accepts a pointer to the data type that needs to be resized and the size of the needed reallocation. In our case we pass in the `input` array and the return value of calling [`sizeof(char)`](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/1.2.html#sizeof). This creates a new spot in the array where we can insert the latest character. This is where we use the 'i' variable that we defined at the top of the program. Each time through the loop we make the array larger by one character and insert the character at the index 'i'. Each time we insert a new character 'i' will be incremented by 1 (i++). Once the user presses enter we break out of the loop and use 'i' one more time to insert the null character at the end. We now have an array containing the exact number of characters entered by the user, but we only had to allocated enough space for one character to begin with. Our users can now enter any amount of characters they’d like. We don’t have to warn them about any limitations or initially over allocate space to handle exceptionally large strings. We’ve dynamically allocated the memory as the user typed and can now do whatever we’d like with the string; in our example program we just print the string back out to show that it works they way we expect it to.\n\nI hope you’ve gained a small amount of knowledge from the tip in this short tutorial. When we’re able to properly and efficiently handle the allocation of memory in our programs, everyone benefits.

Secondly, all \"strings\" in C should be terminated by a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character\">null character</a>. A string in C is nothing more than a contiguous group of individual characters terminated by the null character. Also, by creating our initial character array with enough space for one character we are ensuring that after we’ve dynamically allocated enough space for the string entered by our user we have one spot left at the end for the NULL.</p>\n\n<p>The call to <a href=\"http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/2.13.html#malloc\"><code>malloc()</code></a>, which is how we dynamically initialize memory for a data type at runtime in C, is not guaranteed to return a valid pointer to a properly created memory location. So we next check to see if the input variable is pointing to NULL and if it is we bail out with an error. Once we know we have a pointer to a valid memory location we can ask our user for their input.</p>\n\n<p>After printing the request for input with <a href=\"http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/2.12.html#printf\"><code>printf()</code></a> we enter a <a href=\"http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/1.6.html#while\"><code>while()</code></a> loop which uses <a href=\"http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/2.12.html#getchar\"><code>getchar()</code></a> to grab each character entered by the user one by one. We check to see if it's equal to the newline character ('\\n') which indicates the user hit the enter or return key. This tells us that the user is done typing and we can move on past our while loop. If the character is anything besides a newline we want to store it in our array.</p>\n\n<p>This is where the real magic of the C standard library comes into play. Using the <a href=\"http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/2.13.html#realloc\"><code>realloc()</code></a> function we can dynamically resize the memory space used by a data type at runtime. In our case we want to increase the size of the input array by enough to hold the character just entered by the user. This function accepts a pointer to the data type that needs to be resized and the size of the needed reallocation. In our case we pass in the <code>input</code> array and the return value of calling <a href=\"http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/1.2.html#sizeof\"><code>sizeof(char)</code></a>. This creates a new spot in the array where we can insert the latest character. This is where we use the 'i' variable that we defined at the top of the program. Each time through the loop we make the array larger by one character and insert the character at the index 'i'. Each time we insert a new character 'i' will be incremented by 1 (i++). Once the user presses enter we break out of the loop and use 'i' one more time to insert the null character at the end. We now have an array containing the exact number of characters entered by the user, but we only had to allocated enough space for one character to begin with. Our users can now enter any amount of characters they’d like. We don’t have to warn them about any limitations or initially over allocate space to handle exceptionally large strings. We’ve dynamically allocated the memory as the user typed and can now do whatever we’d like with the string; in our example program we just print the string back out to show that it works they way we expect it to.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you’ve gained a small amount of knowledge from the tip in this short tutorial. When we’re able to properly and efficiently handle the allocation of memory in our programs, everyone benefits.

From government programs and subsidies to political lobbying, these tribes create opportunities for themselves that are unavailable to almost every other minority group in America. Money affords a special few Native American tribes access to an elevated status in the American political system, allowing those tribes to succeed while others languish in poverty.\n\nJames E. Billie, the Seminole Indian Tribe chief from 1979 to 2001, was the first to identify the potential power, wealth and prestige that gambling could provide. After winning the right to build casinos nationwide, these tribes began to structure themselves to conduct their operations as corporations. While the government continues to slash funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC), these new found corporate powerhouses have assembled teams of lawyers and lobbyists to pump capital into the campaigns of those best positioned to wring the maximum amount of subsidies and loose regulation out of the agencies assigned to regulate them. The power and control that the income from their casinos gives them, empowers these tribes to compete for resources on a level that no other minority group can access. Unfortunately, this power is not equally distributed throughout the Native American community. Like all groups with power and influence, the select few tribes that have been able to build casinos use their power to further their own political influence and stature, at the expense of the less fortunate tribes.

From government programs and subsidies to political lobbying, these tribes create opportunities for themselves that are unavailable to almost every other minority group in America.

Billie, the Seminole Indian Tribe chief from 1979 to 2001, was the first to identify the potential power, wealth and prestige that gambling could provide. After winning the right to build casinos nationwide, these tribes began to structure themselves to conduct their operations as corporations. While the government continues to slash funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC), these new found corporate powerhouses have assembled teams of lawyers and lobbyists to pump capital into the campaigns of those best positioned to wring the maximum amount of subsidies and loose regulation out of the agencies assigned to regulate them. The power and control that the income from their casinos gives them, empowers these tribes to compete for resources on a level that no other minority group can access. Unfortunately, this power is not equally distributed throughout the Native American community. Like all groups with power and influence, the select few tribes that have been able to build casinos use their power to further their own political influence and stature, at the expense of the less fortunate tribes.

What's the first thing I wanted to do? Deploy my new personal blog to [Heroku](http://heroku.com)! In my first post on my new Ghost blog I'm going to outline the steps that were necessary for me to first get Ghost running locally and then successfully deploy the site to Heroku.\n\nLike most of you, I've been \"waiting patiently\" for the first release of this new blogging platform. Each chime from Mail carried on it's melody the possibility of a new Ghost update, always wondering: is today the day? That day has finally arrived, and I couldn't wait one more minute to get a look at what the Ghost team had created for us.\n\n## Initial Setup\n\nAccording to a few posts on the [forum](https://en.ghost.org/forum/installation), some of my fellow Ghosters experienced various installation related issues. I was one of the lucky ones that experienced no problems with my install. The first version of the [Ghost installation docs](http://docs.ghost.org/installation/) did an admirable job of getting me up and running in a minimal amount of time. If you haven't read them and gotten your NPM packages installed, you should do that now. The rest of this article will make no sense if you don't.\n\nI started inside the directory that I unzipped directly from the downloaded Ghost v0.3.0 archive. I took a few minutes to peruse the directory structure trying to take note of where some important looking files and folders existed. When I couldn't take it anymore I executed `npm start` and loaded localhost:2368 in Chrome. I entered the obligatory username and password and there it was: the interface I'd been waiting to see for almost four months. I spent some time clicking buttons, exploring the menus and changing various profile settings, but there was code to look at - so I headed over to [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com).\n\nWhile I am not new to Javascript, I am still a newcomer to [Node](http://nodejs.org). Therefore I tried to focus on some of the more common files found in a Node based project. I reviewed `package.json` and `index.js` and then tried to familiarize myself with the content and core directories. Once I felt comfortable with the general layout of the files I poured over `config.js`. I knew there would be plenty of time in the future for digging through the core codebase, my goal at this point was to find any information that may be needed for the eventual deploy to Heroku.\n\nThe config file contained a lot of the settings I knew I'd need during my Heroku deploys. I started experimenting with the settings in the development section to see what I could safely change and what caused major problems. I updated the `url:` property to reflect the address I'd like to use for local development and changed all the `port:` properties to match (I prefer to use localhost:4000 due to development on a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) app using localhost:5000). The database section was going to be where I'd be spending most of my time, but we'll get back to that in a minute.\n\nAt this point I took a few minutes to create a new Heroku app so I could provision some necessary addons and setup its configuration settings to make sure it was ready to receive my first deploy when that time came. If you don't have a Heroku account, or unfamiliar with creating a Heroku app, they have [great documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart) to get you up and running really quickly.\n\n## Mail Configuration\n\nThe Ghost docs were once again very helpful with mail setup. Even though there is no advanced email functionality currently enabled in the Ghost core, I wanted to follow all the directions as closely as possible.\n\nAccording to the Ghost docs:\n\n>At the moment, the only thing Ghost uses email for is sending you an email with a new password if you forget yours.\n\nThe documentation recommends either Mailgun or Sendgrid. The provided example explains setting up Mailgun, but the `config.js` example code is pre-populated with Sendgrid details. I decided on the latter for no particular reason and added their starter [Heroku Addon](https://addons.heroku.com/sendgrid) to my newly created app.\n\nTo test the new settings I entered my Sendgrid details into the mail section of `config.js` and restarted the Ghost server (you always have to restart the server when you update your config settings).\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\ndevelopment: {\n    ...\n    mail: {\n        transport: 'sendgrid',\n        host: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',\n        options: {\n            service: 'Sendgrid',\n            auth: {\n                user: 'SENDGRID_USERNAME',\n                pass: 'SENDGRID_PASSWORD'\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    ...\n},\n```\n\nI logged out of my Ghost site and clicked the Forgot Password link. It asked me for my email address and not 30 seconds later I had an email in my inbox with a new randomly generated password. I was able to use that to login and change my password back to what it was before the reset.\n\nMail settings good to go - time to dump sqlite3.\n\n## Setup Database\n\nFrom the beginning I knew this part was going to cause me the most problems. I was not wrong. Any project with a version number of 0.3.0 is going to be missing specific information about custom configuration. It would be up to me to discover how Ghost accesses a database and then how to tell it to use a different one.\n\nHeroku seems to be in love with [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org) and recommends it as the default <abbr title=\"Relational Database Management System\">RDBMS</abbr> throughout its documentation. So I figured I'd start there and see what happens.\n\n### Postgres\n\nPostgres v9.3 was already installed on my local machine (Mac OSX v10.8.5) from a previous project. If you don't have it installed (spoiler: I ended up using MySQL so you can skip this if you want) and you're on a Mac, you can install it through Homebrew:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\nbrew install postgresql\ninitdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8   # create a database\npg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start  # start the server\n```\n\nThe above commands will install Postgres, initialize a database and then start the server so Ghost can talk to that new database. Unfortunately I have next to no experience administering a Postgres database. I tried several permutations of different configuration settings in the `database:` section of my `config.js` but nothing seemed to work. I was able to get different error messages but that's only fun for a while. I did however learn that Ghost uses the [knex NPM module](https://npmjs.org/package/knex) to communicate with its database. This knowledge didn't help me to get Postgres configured but it's nice to know incase I decide to revist Postgres configuration in the future.\n\nAt this point I was getting frustrated and wanted to see some results. So I decided to fall back on that old workhorse that I was already familiar with:\n\n### MySQL (MariaDB)\n\nCreating the [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org) database and configuring Ghost to talk to it progressed rapidly from this point. I made the assumption that Ghost's (or knex's) MySQL configuration couldn't be that different from the [Rails database.yml](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5872264/correct-mysql-configuration-for-ruby-on-rails-database-yml-file) format. I ended up with the following configuration:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\ndevelopment: {\n    ...\n    database: {\n        client: 'mysql',\n        connection: {\n            database: 'ghost_dev',\n            user: 'MYSQL_USERNAME',\n            password: 'MYSQL_PASSWORD'\n        },\n        debug: false\n    },\n    ...\n},\n```\n\nAs the gods of fate would have it I stumbled across a [forum post](https://en.ghost.org/forum/installation/113-ghost-using-mysql) that addressed these very settings after I'd gotten it up and running, but I'm glad I found a working configuration on my own. I feel a little more comfortable with how the configuration is being used by knex inside the Ghost core. And isn't that what Open Source is all about anyway? If you're paying attention (and following links) then you've noticed that I didn't copy all of the configuration properties out of that forum post. I've done this on purpose. I'm curious about how my database will work and perform if I leave out the `charset: 'utf8'` property. So far it seems to be working fine. But if I come across any errors that can be resolved by adding that property, I'll update this post with more specific information.\n\n### NPM Modules\n\nTo get Ghost (and knex) talking to MariaDB I needed to adjust the NPM packages defined in `package.json`. As we already know, Ghost uses [sqlite](https://sqlite.org) by default. To access a MySQL database I knew I was going to need a new NPM module that provided this functionality. A quick [search](https://npmjs.org/search?q=mysql) on the NPM site returned the [module](https://npmjs.org/package/mysql) I was going to need. But how do I tell Ghost to use this module and not the sqlite module? As I mentioned above, I'm still new to Node, so my solution may not be the best. I already knew that all module dependencies are declared in `package.json`. So I started looking for the sqlite declaration. Once I found it I replaced it with the new mysql module. But I didn't know the correct version to declare. Running the command `npm info mysql` returned a bunch of details including the latest version number. I now had the information I needed:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\n\"mysql\": \"2.0.0-alpha9\",\n```\n\nI then ran `npm uninstall sqlite` and `npm install`. This removed the sqlite module and installed mysql in its place along with updating any new dependencies created by the change. I'm curous as to how future Ghost updates will handle local changes to the `package.json` file. I'm concerned that a new version will overwrite this file breaking my custom mysql configuration. For now I'll just keep an eye on how new versions are released and make sure my local file is properly merged with any newer versions.\n\n---\n\nBefore we continue I think we should recap to ensure we're all still on the same page. Here's what I'd accomplished up to this point:\n\n1. Downloaded Ghost and installed dependencies per the official documentation\n2. Verified server runs with all default configuration\n3. Created empty Heroku app\n4. Configured and verified mail settings through Sendgrid\n5. Successfully configured Ghost to use a MariaDB database\n\nNow that I had Ghost running locally with all the configuration that would be needed inside a Heroku app, it was time to get my repo ready for it's first deploy.\n\n## Heroku Config & Deploy\n\nDeveloping an application that will be deployed to the Heroku platform is an interesting  process. Heroku operates very differently from a traditional shared hosting or VPS based  service. Heroku runs each application in a self-contained unit they call a [Dyno](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos). Your app's Dyno is a compiled and segregated unit that exists inside Heroku's system as a transient instance that will be created and destroyed whenever it's started and stopped. [Hannah](https://en.ghost.org/Hannah) points out one important drawback that needs to be considered when choosing Heroku in this [forum post](https://en.ghost.org/forum/installation/69-about-heroku):\n\n>You can setup with MySQL but be warned the Heroku file system is refreshed every so often, so you would lose any uploaded images.\n\nIf this is an issue for you I'd recommend sticking with a more traditional hosting account (i.e. Amazon EC2) until Ghost matures a little more. In order to execute your local development application in an environment that most closely mimics the Heroku environment we need to configure a few tools and files.\n\n### The Tools\n\nWhen you first setup your Heroku environment on your local machine you should have installed the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com). This small collection of tools ensures you have Git, the Foreman gem and the Heroku command line client installed. The Git source control management software is necessary because Heroku uses your git repository to create a new Dyno whenever you push your changes up to their platform. The foreman gem allows you to execute your application locally in a similar manner to how your Dyno will be executed on Heroku's platform. The Heroku command line client allows access to your remote Heroku account and apps to view logs, provision addons, start and stop your applications and many other administrative tasks. To see all the available commands, run this from the root of your application:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\nheroku help\n```\n\n### .env\n\nAn application that's been deployed to Heroku relies heavily on environment variables that are made available to your Dyno by Heroku at runtime. We need a way to recreate these variables in our local environment. The foreman gem allows us to do this in two ways. First it will execute your app using the commands in a `Procfile` (discussed next) and by reading predefined environment variables in a `.env` file.\n\nIn a public project, one that might also be pushed to Github or another public git repository, your `.env` should be excluded from your repository. Your `.env` could contain private keys, secrets or credentials that are needed to run your application properly but shouldn't be accessible to the public at large. You can keep this file out of source control by running this command from the root of your project:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\necho .env >> .gitignore\n```\n\nMy blog is not going to be pushed up to any server other than my Heroku account, which is private, so this step was not necessary for me. In my local environment I only need a few environment variables. The first is the node environment in which my application will run. Ghost uses this variable to decide what configuration to load and which specific pieces of code to execute. We can tell Ghost which environment to execute by adding the variable to our `.env` file:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\nNODE_ENV=development\n```\n\nI would also like to access my Sendgrid credentials in `config.js` through environment variables. This step is necessary if you're going to push your app to a public git repository. Your `config.js` has to be included in source control, but you don't want to  hard-code your Sendgrid username and password for the whole world to see. I added two more environment variables to my `.env`:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\nSENDGRID_USERNAME=my-sendgrid-username\nSENDGRID_PASSWORD=my-sendgrid-password\n```\n\nI can now access these credentials from `config.js` by editing my mail configuration section a little:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\ndevelopment: {\n    ...\n    mail: {\n        transport: 'sendgrid',\n        host: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',\n        options: {\n            service: 'Sendgrid',\n            auth: {\n                user: process.env.SENDGRID_USERNAME,\n                pass: process.env.SENDGRID_PASSWORD\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    ...\n},\n```\n\nAgain, this works because the foreman gem will read your `.env` file when you launch you app and make these variables available to your app's runtime environment through `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`. If you are going to push your app to a public repository I would suggest creating additional variables in your `.env` for your database credentials. As my repo will not be publicly deployed, I skipped this step. For now, my local database credentials are hard-coded into my `config.js`.\n\n### Procfile\n\nAs I mentioned above, the foreman gem will run your application by executing a command from your Procfile. This command is also the one that Heroku will execute when launching your application after each deploy. So what command should we execute? We need our Procfile to use the same command that gets executed when we run `npm start`. But what command does `npm start` execute? Ghost's `package.json` configuration defines two \"scripts\" that can be run with the `npm` command:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node index\",\n    \"test\": \"grunt validate --verbose\"\n},\n```\n\nHere we can clearly see that running `npm start` will actually execute the command `node index`. This is the information we need to correctly configure our Procfile. Because this is a simple blog that doesn't need to do much more than serve web pages, we'll create the Procfile with the appropriate command in one step:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\necho \"web: node index.js\" > Procfile\n```\n\nHeroku allows you to run two different types of processes: web and worker. The web process answers HTTP requests and a worker process handles background jobs. A Ghost blog doesn't need any background workers so we don't need any `worker:` declarations, but if you'd like to learn more about them, Heroku has a great introduction [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/background-jobs-queueing).\n\nWe can now verify that our configuration is correct by launching our local development app using the foreman gem. Run this command from the root of you app:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\nforeman start\n```\n\nIf you see something similar to the following output, you're good to go:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\n4:46:26 web.1      | started with pid 24188\n14:46:27 web.1     | Ghost is running...\n14:46:27 web.1     | Listening on 127.0.0.1:4000\n14:46:27 web.1     | Url configured as: localhost:4000\n14:46:27 web.1     | Ctrl+C to shut down\n```\n\nYou should be able to view your app in your browser in exactly the same way as you did when you ran `npm start`.\n\n### Heroku Environment Variables\n\nNow that my local app was configured to access environment variables and execute in the same way Heroku was going to run it, I needed to prepare my Heroku app to provide similar environment variables and configuration. How do we tell Heroku to make environment variables available to our app's runtime environment? This is where the `heroku` command line client come in. First I needed to make sure that the proper node environment is defined as well as my Sendgrid credentials. We can set remote Heroku variables using the `heroku config:set` command:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\nheroku config:set NODE_ENV=production\nheroku config:set SENDGRID_USERNAME=my-sendgrid-username\nheroku config:set SENDGRID_PASSWORD=my-sendgrid-password\n```\n\nYou can verify these settings by running `heroku config`. That command will output all environment variables currently set in your remote environment. Once I knew these variables would be available to my app during runtime in its Dyno I had only one more hurdle to clear: **how in the heck was I going to access a database?**\n\nIf you remember I couldn't get Postgres to work above, so I fell back on MariaDB. I now needed to provision a Heroku addon that would provide a MySQL database and then create the appropriate variables that would allow my Heroku app to access it. There is only one MySQL addon available on Heroku: [ClearDB](https://addons.heroku.com/cleardb). So I added the free \"Ignite\" plan which offers 10 connections and a 5 MB database. This should be fine to start with, but any serious blogger would need to upgrade rather quickly to the \"Punch\" plan, which costs $9.99/mo and increases your database size to 1 GB with 15 connections.\n\n**Be warned**: Heroku makes automated deploys almost brainless but can get expensive rather quickly.\n\nNow that I had a database provisioned and ready to access, how do I configure Ghost to talk to it? The ClearDB addon creates its own environment variable which your app can use to communicate with the DB. This new variable's name is: `CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL` and takes the following form:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\nmysql://username:password@hostname/database_name\n```\n\nI wasn't sure how advanced the knex npm module would be when it came to parsing database connection URLs so I first tried to configure my database settings in `config.js` using just this URL:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\n// ### Production\n// When running Ghost in the wild, use the production environment\n// Configure your URL and mail settings here\nproduction: {\n    database: {\n        client: 'mysql',\n        connection: {\n            database: process.env.CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL\n        },\n        debug: false\n    },\n},\n```\n\nThis meant it was time for my first attempt at a Ghost Heroku deploy. If you're following along at home, and you haven't yet turned your app's directory into a git repo, run the following command from the root of your app:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\ngit init && git add . && git commit -m \"Initial Commit\"\n```\n\nThis will initialize a git repository, add all files and then commit them. If you didn't create your Heroku app from the command line by running `heroku create` then you'll also need to add your Heroku app's repository as a remote:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\ngit remote add heroku your-apps-repo-name\n```\n\nYou can get `your-apps-repo-name` from the Settings area of your Heroku Dashboard under the heading \"Info\". Once your app is initialized as a git repo and the proper remote has been added a Heroku deploy is as simple as running:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\ngit push heroku master\n```\n\nThat command pushes your local git repo up to your remote Heroku repo and kicks off Heroku's internal deploy procedures. A slug is compiled for your app and a new Dyno is initialized and launched to execute that slug and answer HTTP requests.\n\nUnfortunately my first deploy failed and the output of running `heroku logs` returned the same database errors I received while trying to setup Postgres. Obviously my database configuration in the production section of my `config.js` was incorrect. I tried many iterations with different permutations of the database settings until I found one that worked. Here is the final configuration in the production section of my `config.js`:\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\nproduction: {\n    mail: {\n        transport: 'sendgrid',\n        host: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',\n        options: {\n            service: 'Sendgrid',\n            auth: {\n                user: process.env.SENDGRID_USERNAME,\n                pass: process.env.SENDGRID_PASSWORD\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    database: {\n        client: 'mysql',\n        connection: {\n            database: process.env.DATABASE_NAME,\n            host: process.env.DATABASE_HOST,\n            user: process.env.DATABASE_USER,\n            password: process.env.DATABASE_PASS\n        },\n        debug: false\n    },\n    server: {\n        host: '0.0.0.0',\n        port: process.env.PORT\n    }\n},\n```\n\nAs you can see I had to parse the `CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL` into separate variables so I could pass them individually. I set the appropriate remote variables with the following commands (refer to the ClearDB example format above):\n\n<?prettify?>\n```\nheroku config:set DATABASE_NAME=database_name\nheroku config:set DATABASE_HOST=hostname\nheroku config:set DATABASE_USER=username\nheroku config:set DATABASE_PASS=password\n```\n\nAs soon as I had those variables set and `config.js` setup properly Ghost loaded right up and I ran through the signup process with no issues. I had successfully configured and deployed Ghost to Heroku running on top of a MySQL database! I also updated the `server:` section to use the HOSTNAME and PORT that Heroku creates for every Dyno. I'm not sure if the `host:` property is required but the `port:` property is. Without it, you're Dyno would not know how to communicate with Heroku's router.\n\n## Conclusion & Next Steps\n\nAfter a long wait, much anticipation and a lot of trial and error, I'm rockin' a new Ghost blog on Heroku. There is still much to do. I'm excited to see what new versions will offer us as well as for the official public release on Github. For my next projects I'm going to investigate how avatars are handled internally to see if I can add support for [Gravatars](http://en.gravatar.com) if no image has been uploaded and then begin customizing the default Casper theme so I can learn how to create my own custom themes. [This forum post](https://en.ghost.org/forum/themes/17-marketplace) states that the Ghost Marketplace will eventually be opened up to us all. I look forward to submitting some open source themes for the community to use.\n\nI hope some of you learned something new about Ghost and maybe even got your site up on Heroku with the help of this post. I'll be back with something new soon...\n\n### Useful Links\n\nThese are just a few links I thought might be helpful with Ghost configuration or a Heroku deploy:\n\n1.

Each chime from Mail carried on it's melody the possibility of a new Ghost update, always wondering: is today the day? That day has finally arrived, and I couldn't wait one more minute to get a look at what the Ghost team had created for us.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"initialsetup\">Initial Setup</h2>\n\n<p>According to a few posts on the <a href=\"https://en.ghost.org/forum/installation\">forum</a>, some of my fellow Ghosters experienced various installation related issues. I was one of the lucky ones that experienced no problems with my install. The first version of the <a href=\"http://docs.ghost.org/installation/\">Ghost installation docs</a> did an admirable job of getting me up and running in a minimal amount of time. If you haven't read them and gotten your NPM packages installed, you should do that now. The rest of this article will make no sense if you don't.</p>\n\n<p>I started inside the directory that I unzipped directly from the downloaded Ghost v0.3.0 archive. I took a few minutes to peruse the directory structure trying to take note of where some important looking files and folders existed. When I couldn't take it anymore I executed <code>npm start</code> and loaded localhost:2368 in Chrome. I entered the obligatory username and password and there it was: the interface I'd been waiting to see for almost four months. I spent some time clicking buttons, exploring the menus and changing various profile settings, but there was code to look at - so I headed over to <a href=\"http://www.sublimetext.com\">Sublime</a>.</p>\n\n<p>While I am not new to Javascript, I am still a newcomer to <a href=\"http://nodejs.org\">Node</a>. Therefore I tried to focus on some of the more common files found in a Node based project. I reviewed <code>package.json</code> and <code>index.js</code> and then tried to familiarize myself with the content and core directories. Once I felt comfortable with the general layout of the files I poured over <code>config.js</code>. I knew there would be plenty of time in the future for digging through the core codebase, my goal at this point was to find any information that may be needed for the eventual deploy to Heroku.</p>\n\n<p>The config file contained a lot of the settings I knew I'd need during my Heroku deploys. I started experimenting with the settings in the development section to see what I could safely change and what caused major problems. I updated the <code>url:</code> property to reflect the address I'd like to use for local development and changed all the <code>port:</code> properties to match (I prefer to use localhost:4000 due to development on a <a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org\">Rails</a> app using localhost:5000). The database section was going to be where I'd be spending most of my time, but we'll get back to that in a minute.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I took a few minutes to create a new Heroku app so I could provision some necessary addons and setup its configuration settings to make sure it was ready to receive my first deploy when that time came. If you don't have a Heroku account, or unfamiliar with creating a Heroku app, they have <a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart\">great documentation</a> to get you up and running really quickly.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mailconfiguration\">Mail Configuration</h2>\n\n<p>The Ghost docs were once again very helpful with mail setup. Even though there is no advanced email functionality currently enabled in the Ghost core, I wanted to follow all the directions as closely as possible.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Ghost docs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At the moment, the only thing Ghost uses email for is sending you an email with a new password if you forget yours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The documentation recommends either Mailgun or Sendgrid. The provided example explains setting up Mailgun, but the <code>config.js</code> example code is pre-populated with Sendgrid details. I decided on the latter for no particular reason and added their starter <a href=\"https://addons.heroku.com/sendgrid\">Heroku Addon</a> to my newly created app.</p>\n\n<p>To test the new settings I entered my Sendgrid details into the mail section of <code>config.js</code> and restarted the Ghost server (you always have to restart the server when you update your config settings).</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>development: {  \n    ...\n    mail: {\n        transport: 'sendgrid',\n        host: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',\n        options: {\n            service: 'Sendgrid',\n            auth: {\n                user: 'SENDGRID_USERNAME',\n                pass: 'SENDGRID_PASSWORD'\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    ...\n},\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I logged out of my Ghost site and clicked the Forgot Password link. It asked me for my email address and not 30 seconds later I had an email in my inbox with a new randomly generated password. I was able to use that to login and change my password back to what it was before the reset.</p>\n\n<p>Mail settings good to go - time to dump sqlite3.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"setupdatabase\">Setup Database</h2>\n\n<p>From the beginning I knew this part was going to cause me the most problems. I was not wrong. Any project with a version number of 0.3.0 is going to be missing specific information about custom configuration. It would be up to me to discover how Ghost accesses a database and then how to tell it to use a different one.</p>\n\n<p>Heroku seems to be in love with <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org\">Postgres</a> and recommends it as the default <abbr title=\"Relational Database Management System\">RDBMS</abbr> throughout its documentation. So I figured I'd start there and see what happens.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"postgres\">Postgres</h3>\n\n<p>Postgres v9.3 was already installed on my local machine (Mac OSX v10.8.5) from a previous project. If you don't have it installed (spoiler: I ended up using MySQL so you can skip this if you want) and you're on a Mac, you can install it through Homebrew:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>brew install postgresql  \ninitdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8   # create a database  \npg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start  # start the server  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above commands will install Postgres, initialize a database and then start the server so Ghost can talk to that new database. Unfortunately I have next to no experience administering a Postgres database. I tried several permutations of different configuration settings in the <code>database:</code> section of my <code>config.js</code> but nothing seemed to work. I was able to get different error messages but that's only fun for a while. I did however learn that Ghost uses the <a href=\"https://npmjs.org/package/knex\">knex NPM module</a> to communicate with its database. This knowledge didn't help me to get Postgres configured but it's nice to know incase I decide to revist Postgres configuration in the future.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I was getting frustrated and wanted to see some results. So I decided to fall back on that old workhorse that I was already familiar with:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mysqlmariadb\">MySQL (MariaDB)</h3>\n\n<p>Creating the <a href=\"https://mariadb.org\">MariaDB</a> database and configuring Ghost to talk to it progressed rapidly from this point. I made the assumption that Ghost's (or knex's) MySQL configuration couldn't be that different from the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5872264/correct-mysql-configuration-for-ruby-on-rails-database-yml-file\">Rails database.yml</a> format. I ended up with the following configuration:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>development: {  \n    ...\n    database: {\n        client: 'mysql',\n        connection: {\n            database: 'ghost_dev',\n            user: 'MYSQL_USERNAME',\n            password: 'MYSQL_PASSWORD'\n        },\n        debug: false\n    },\n    ...\n},\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As the gods of fate would have it I stumbled across a <a href=\"https://en.ghost.org/forum/installation/113-ghost-using-mysql\">forum post</a> that addressed these very settings after I'd gotten it up and running, but I'm glad I found a working configuration on my own. I feel a little more comfortable with how the configuration is being used by knex inside the Ghost core. And isn't that what Open Source is all about anyway? If you're paying attention (and following links) then you've noticed that I didn't copy all of the configuration properties out of that forum post. I've done this on purpose. I'm curious about how my database will work and perform if I leave out the <code>charset: 'utf8'</code> property. So far it seems to be working fine. But if I come across any errors that can be resolved by adding that property, I'll update this post with more specific information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"npmmodules\">NPM Modules</h3>\n\n<p>To get Ghost (and knex) talking to MariaDB I needed to adjust the NPM packages defined in <code>package.json</code>. As we already know, Ghost uses <a href=\"https://sqlite.org\">sqlite</a> by default. To access a MySQL database I knew I was going to need a new NPM module that provided this functionality. A quick <a href=\"https://npmjs.org/search?q=mysql\">search</a> on the NPM site returned the <a href=\"https://npmjs.org/package/mysql\">module</a> I was going to need. But how do I tell Ghost to use this module and not the sqlite module? As I mentioned above, I'm still new to Node, so my solution may not be the best. I already knew that all module dependencies are declared in <code>package.json</code>. So I started looking for the sqlite declaration. Once I found it I replaced it with the new mysql module. But I didn't know the correct version to declare. Running the command <code>npm info mysql</code> returned a bunch of details including the latest version number. I now had the information I needed:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>\"mysql\": \"2.0.0-alpha9\",\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I then ran <code>npm uninstall sqlite</code> and <code>npm install</code>. This removed the sqlite module and installed mysql in its place along with updating any new dependencies created by the change. I'm curous as to how future Ghost updates will handle local changes to the <code>package.json</code> file. I'm concerned that a new version will overwrite this file breaking my custom mysql configuration. For now I'll just keep an eye on how new versions are released and make sure my local file is properly merged with any newer versions.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Before we continue I think we should recap to ensure we're all still on the same page. Here's what I'd accomplished up to this point:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Downloaded Ghost and installed dependencies per the official documentation  </li>\n<li>Verified server runs with all default configuration  </li>\n<li>Created empty Heroku app  </li>\n<li>Configured and verified mail settings through Sendgrid  </li>\n<li>Successfully configured Ghost to use a MariaDB database</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now that I had Ghost running locally with all the configuration that would be needed inside a Heroku app, it was time to get my repo ready for it's first deploy.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"herokuconfigdeploy\">Heroku Config &amp; Deploy</h2>\n\n<p>Developing an application that will be deployed to the Heroku platform is an interesting  process. Heroku operates very differently from a traditional shared hosting or VPS based  service. Heroku runs each application in a self-contained unit they call a <a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos\">Dyno</a>. Your app's Dyno is a compiled and segregated unit that exists inside Heroku's system as a transient instance that will be created and destroyed whenever it's started and stopped. <a href=\"https://en.ghost.org/Hannah\">Hannah</a> points out one important drawback that needs to be considered when choosing Heroku in this <a href=\"https://en.ghost.org/forum/installation/69-about-heroku\">forum post</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can setup with MySQL but be warned the Heroku file system is refreshed every so often, so you would lose any uploaded images.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this is an issue for you I'd recommend sticking with a more traditional hosting account (i.e. Amazon EC2) until Ghost matures a little more. In order to execute your local development application in an environment that most closely mimics the Heroku environment we need to configure a few tools and files.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"thetools\">The Tools</h3>\n\n<p>When you first setup your Heroku environment on your local machine you should have installed the <a href=\"https://toolbelt.heroku.com\">Heroku Toolbelt</a>. This small collection of tools ensures you have Git, the Foreman gem and the Heroku command line client installed. The Git source control management software is necessary because Heroku uses your git repository to create a new Dyno whenever you push your changes up to their platform. The foreman gem allows you to execute your application locally in a similar manner to how your Dyno will be executed on Heroku's platform. The Heroku command line client allows access to your remote Heroku account and apps to view logs, provision addons, start and stop your applications and many other administrative tasks. To see all the available commands, run this from the root of your application:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>heroku help  \n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"env\">.env</h3>\n\n<p>An application that's been deployed to Heroku relies heavily on environment variables that are made available to your Dyno by Heroku at runtime. We need a way to recreate these variables in our local environment. The foreman gem allows us to do this in two ways. First it will execute your app using the commands in a <code>Procfile</code> (discussed next) and by reading predefined environment variables in a <code>.env</code> file.</p>\n\n<p>In a public project, one that might also be pushed to Github or another public git repository, your <code>.env</code> should be excluded from your repository. Your <code>.env</code> could contain private keys, secrets or credentials that are needed to run your application properly but shouldn't be accessible to the public at large. You can keep this file out of source control by running this command from the root of your project:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>echo .env &gt;&gt; .gitignore  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My blog is not going to be pushed up to any server other than my Heroku account, which is private, so this step was not necessary for me. In my local environment I only need a few environment variables. The first is the node environment in which my application will run. Ghost uses this variable to decide what configuration to load and which specific pieces of code to execute. We can tell Ghost which environment to execute by adding the variable to our <code>.env</code> file:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>NODE_ENV=development  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would also like to access my Sendgrid credentials in <code>config.js</code> through environment variables. This step is necessary if you're going to push your app to a public git repository. Your <code>config.js</code> has to be included in source control, but you don't want to  hard-code your Sendgrid username and password for the whole world to see. I added two more environment variables to my <code>.env</code>:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>SENDGRID_USERNAME=my-sendgrid-username  \nSENDGRID_PASSWORD=my-sendgrid-password  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can now access these credentials from <code>config.js</code> by editing my mail configuration section a little:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>development: {  \n    ...\n    mail: {\n        transport: 'sendgrid',\n        host: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',\n        options: {\n            service: 'Sendgrid',\n            auth: {\n                user: process.env.SENDGRID_USERNAME,\n                pass: process.env.SENDGRID_PASSWORD\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    ...\n},\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, this works because the foreman gem will read your <code>.env</code> file when you launch you app and make these variables available to your app's runtime environment through <code>process.env.VARIABLE_NAME</code>. If you are going to push your app to a public repository I would suggest creating additional variables in your <code>.env</code> for your database credentials. As my repo will not be publicly deployed, I skipped this step. For now, my local database credentials are hard-coded into my <code>config.js</code>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"procfile\">Procfile</h3>\n\n<p>As I mentioned above, the foreman gem will run your application by executing a command from your Procfile. This command is also the one that Heroku will execute when launching your application after each deploy. So what command should we execute? We need our Procfile to use the same command that gets executed when we run <code>npm start</code>. But what command does <code>npm start</code> execute? Ghost's <code>package.json</code> configuration defines two \"scripts\" that can be run with the <code>npm</code> command:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>\"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node index\",\n    \"test\": \"grunt validate --verbose\"\n},\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we can clearly see that running <code>npm start</code> will actually execute the command <code>node index</code>. This is the information we need to correctly configure our Procfile. Because this is a simple blog that doesn't need to do much more than serve web pages, we'll create the Procfile with the appropriate command in one step:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>echo \"web: node index.js\" &gt; Procfile  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Heroku allows you to run two different types of processes: web and worker. The web process answers HTTP requests and a worker process handles background jobs. A Ghost blog doesn't need any background workers so we don't need any <code>worker:</code> declarations, but if you'd like to learn more about them, Heroku has a great introduction <a href=\"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/background-jobs-queueing\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We can now verify that our configuration is correct by launching our local development app using the foreman gem. Run this command from the root of you app:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>foreman start  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you see something similar to the following output, you're good to go:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>4:46:26 web.1      | started with pid 24188  \n14:46:27 web.1     | Ghost is running...  \n14:46:27 web.1     | Listening on 127.0.0.1:4000  \n14:46:27 web.1     | Url configured as: localhost:4000  \n14:46:27 web.1     | Ctrl+C to shut down  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You should be able to view your app in your browser in exactly the same way as you did when you ran <code>npm start</code>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"herokuenvironmentvariables\">Heroku Environment Variables</h3>\n\n<p>Now that my local app was configured to access environment variables and execute in the same way Heroku was going to run it, I needed to prepare my Heroku app to provide similar environment variables and configuration. How do we tell Heroku to make environment variables available to our app's runtime environment? This is where the <code>heroku</code> command line client come in. First I needed to make sure that the proper node environment is defined as well as my Sendgrid credentials. We can set remote Heroku variables using the <code>heroku config:set</code> command:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production  \nheroku config:set SENDGRID_USERNAME=my-sendgrid-username  \nheroku config:set SENDGRID_PASSWORD=my-sendgrid-password  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can verify these settings by running <code>heroku config</code>. That command will output all environment variables currently set in your remote environment. Once I knew these variables would be available to my app during runtime in its Dyno I had only one more hurdle to clear: <strong>how in the heck was I going to access a database?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you remember I couldn't get Postgres to work above, so I fell back on MariaDB. I now needed to provision a Heroku addon that would provide a MySQL database and then create the appropriate variables that would allow my Heroku app to access it. There is only one MySQL addon available on Heroku: <a href=\"https://addons.heroku.com/cleardb\">ClearDB</a>. So I added the free \"Ignite\" plan which offers 10 connections and a 5 MB database. This should be fine to start with, but any serious blogger would need to upgrade rather quickly to the \"Punch\" plan, which costs $9.99/mo and increases your database size to 1 GB with 15 connections.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Be warned</strong>: Heroku makes automated deploys almost brainless but can get expensive rather quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I had a database provisioned and ready to access, how do I configure Ghost to talk to it? The ClearDB addon creates its own environment variable which your app can use to communicate with the DB. This new variable's name is: <code>CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL</code> and takes the following form:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>mysql://username:password@hostname/database_name  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I wasn't sure how advanced the knex npm module would be when it came to parsing database connection URLs so I first tried to configure my database settings in <code>config.js</code> using just this URL:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>// ### Production\n// When running Ghost in the wild, use the production environment\n// Configure your URL and mail settings here\nproduction: {  \n    database: {\n        client: 'mysql',\n        connection: {\n            database: process.env.CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL\n        },\n        debug: false\n    },\n},\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This meant it was time for my first attempt at a Ghost Heroku deploy. If you're following along at home, and you haven't yet turned your app's directory into a git repo, run the following command from the root of your app:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>git init &amp;&amp; git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m \"Initial Commit\"  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will initialize a git repository, add all files and then commit them. If you didn't create your Heroku app from the command line by running <code>heroku create</code> then you'll also need to add your Heroku app's repository as a remote:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>git remote add heroku your-apps-repo-name  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can get <code>your-apps-repo-name</code> from the Settings area of your Heroku Dashboard under the heading \"Info\". Once your app is initialized as a git repo and the proper remote has been added a Heroku deploy is as simple as running:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>git push heroku master  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That command pushes your local git repo up to your remote Heroku repo and kicks off Heroku's internal deploy procedures. A slug is compiled for your app and a new Dyno is initialized and launched to execute that slug and answer HTTP requests.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately my first deploy failed and the output of running <code>heroku logs</code> returned the same database errors I received while trying to setup Postgres. Obviously my database configuration in the production section of my <code>config.js</code> was incorrect. I tried many iterations with different permutations of the database settings until I found one that worked. Here is the final configuration in the production section of my <code>config.js</code>:</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>production: {  \n    mail: {\n        transport: 'sendgrid',\n        host: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',\n        options: {\n            service: 'Sendgrid',\n            auth: {\n                user: process.env.SENDGRID_USERNAME,\n                pass: process.env.SENDGRID_PASSWORD\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    database: {\n        client: 'mysql',\n        connection: {\n            database: process.env.DATABASE_NAME,\n            host: process.env.DATABASE_HOST,\n            user: process.env.DATABASE_USER,\n            password: process.env.DATABASE_PASS\n        },\n        debug: false\n    },\n    server: {\n        host: '0.0.0.0',\n        port: process.env.PORT\n    }\n},\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see I had to parse the <code>CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL</code> into separate variables so I could pass them individually. I set the appropriate remote variables with the following commands (refer to the ClearDB example format above):</p>\n\n<?prettify?>  \n\n<pre><code>heroku config:set DATABASE_NAME=database_name  \nheroku config:set DATABASE_HOST=hostname  \nheroku config:set DATABASE_USER=username  \nheroku config:set DATABASE_PASS=password  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As soon as I had those variables set and <code>config.js</code> setup properly Ghost loaded right up and I ran through the signup process with no issues. I had successfully configured and deployed Ghost to Heroku running on top of a MySQL database! I also updated the <code>server:</code> section to use the HOSTNAME and PORT that Heroku creates for every Dyno. I'm not sure if the <code>host:</code> property is required but the <code>port:</code> property is. Without it, you're Dyno would not know how to communicate with Heroku's router.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusionnextsteps\">Conclusion &amp; Next Steps</h2>\n\n<p>After a long wait, much anticipation and a lot of trial and error, I'm rockin' a new Ghost blog on Heroku. There is still much to do. I'm excited to see what new versions will offer us as well as for the official public release on Github. For my next projects I'm going to investigate how avatars are handled internally to see if I can add support for <a href=\"http://en.gravatar.com\">Gravatars</a> if no image has been uploaded and then begin customizing the default Casper theme so I can learn how to create my own custom themes. <a href=\"https://en.ghost.org/forum/themes/17-marketplace\">This forum post</a> states that the Ghost Marketplace will eventually be opened up to us all. I look forward to submitting some open source themes for the community to use.</p>\n\n<p>I hope some of you learned something new about Ghost and maybe even got your site up on Heroku with the help of this post. I'll be back with something new soon...</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"usefullinks\">Useful Links</h3>\n\n<p>These are just a few links I thought might be helpful with Ghost configuration or a Heroku deploy:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.ghost.org\">The Ghost Guide</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.ghost.org/forum/\">The Ghost Forums</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://marketplace.ghost.org\">The Ghost Marketplace</a>  </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.howtoinstallghost.com/how-to-install-ghost-on-heroku/\">Another Ghost Heroku deploy tutorial</a></li>\n</ol>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2013-12-12T10:21:36.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2013-12-12T10:21:36.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2013-09-24T16:00:00.000Z","published_by":1},{"id":9,"uuid":"fe655829-7691-4d1d-93ea-323bbfdcd979","title":"Personal Log 2","slug":"personal-log-2","markdown":"I was recently asked \"If you could design a woman fit for Dom, what would the personality traits, looks, etc be?\"\n\nThis was my answer:\n\nFirst and foremost she would have a completely open mind. She would be both willing and eager to question everything and be dying to discuss those questions with me. She would have a completely silly sense of humor, amused by the smallest and corniest things. She would be tolerant of others and not pass judgement on people. She would be more concerned with what she could do for someone else before she did something for herself. She would read to expand her understanding as much as she reads for enjoyment (basically she would be smarter than me). This will prob sound weird but she would wear a baseball cap. For two reasons, because for some reason I find it irresistible, and because she would never be concerned with \"how her hair looked.\" She would rather just pull it through the back of a cap and get on with her day.

She would be both willing and eager to question everything and be dying to discuss those questions with me. She would have a completely silly sense of humor, amused by the smallest and corniest things. She would be tolerant of others and not pass judgement on people. She would be more concerned with what she could do for someone else before she did something for herself. She would read to expand her understanding as much as she reads for enjoyment (basically she would be smarter than me). This will prob sound weird but she would wear a baseball cap.

This is due to the fact that 97% of our little world is covered by water. This divine liquid has given rise to every form of life that currently exists on our planet as well as all the others that came before us. It is often said that water is the elixir of life. More specifically it is clean, drinkable, potable water that is the true enabler of not only our physical evolution but, more importantly, the ability of entire civilizations to pull themselves out of poverty and into productive, economically viable societies. Access to clean drinking water is most often the deciding factor in determining the heath and well being of a people. Unfortunately this all-important ingredient in the success of a stable and progressive society is often the hardest resource to acquire. If the global community cannot agree on a course of action to secure access to clean water for all inhabitants of our pale blue dot then not only will most of our fellow earthlings perish from disease and famine, many more will suffer in the eventual conflicts over the most basic of human needs…thirst.\n\nAccording to “For want of a drink”, an article from The Economist, there were 2.5 billion people on the earth 60 years ago, that number rose to 6 billion by the year 2000 and now, only 11 years later, we are rapidly approaching 7 billion. It’s estimated that by the middle of this century we will have passed the 9 billion mark (3). In the face of such rapidly increasing numbers of human beings, all with a need to access clean water for food and basic survival, its hard to imagine how such a demand can be met by so little a supply. The instinct to survive is one of the strongest motivators for our species. The lack of access to water for the most basic of services is a situation poised to explode into regional conflicts that could potentially dwarf all of the wars of the past 1,000 years. Countries chronically short of water at the turn of the 21st century accounted for 8% of the world’s population (500m people), this number will rise to 45% (4 billion people) by 2050 (For want of a drink, 4). This staggering statistic means that by mid century almost half of the world’s population will be faced with the prospect of death if they can’t get their hands on water. More than one billion people lack access to clean water supplies and more than 2 billion lack access to basic sanitation (Hoffman, 57). The severity of the problem becomes clearer when you take into account the fact that the earth’s fresh water supplies are not uniformly distributed. A mere nine countries account for 60% of all available fresh water supplies with China and India, the world’s two most populated countries, possessing less than 10% of the earth’s fresh water (For want of a drink, 5).\n\nOne of the regions notoriously short on water is of course the Middle East. Many people forget that the lead up to the 1967 war in that region started with a disagreement between Israel and Syria over control of the water in the Jordan River. Allan Hoffman of the U.S. Department of Energy reports that the “total water supply on the earth is 329 million cubic miles with each cubic mile containing more than 1 trillion gallons. 317 million cubic miles of that water, or just over 96 percent, is found in the oceans and is saline. Another 7 million cubic miles is tied up in icecaps and glaciers, and 3.1 million cubic miles is in the earth's atmosphere. Ground water, fresh water lakes and rivers account for just over 2 million cubic miles of fresh water. The net result is that 99.7 percent of all the water on earth is not available for human consumption. Of the remaining 0.3 percent of water, the vast majority is stored in ground water” (Hoffman, 57). The possibility of an increase in the number conflicts over this incredibly scarce resource in the coming decades becomes even clearer when you consider the link between water and energy. The United States relies heavily on the oil sitting beneath the sands of the Middle East. The lack of access to water in that region could potentially threaten our access to the oil we’ve become addicted to.\n\nA considerable amount of energy is expended in the acquisition of water. We use energy to pump water from aquifers, to transport water through pipelines and to manage and treat waste-water for reuse. Additionally, many of the desalinization plants used to create clean drinking water from ocean water are powered by fossil fuels. The use of fossil fuels compounds our water issues by contributing to climate change, which ultimately effects the distribution of precipitation across the globe through the warming of our atmosphere. The lack of access to affordable, environmentally friendly energy only exacerbates the problems faced by both developed and developing nations in their efforts to secure clean water. Furthermore, the link between water and energy is bi-directional. Not only do we expend energy in the search for water, we also use water resources in the generation of energy. The cooling of nuclear power plants is one of the most noted examples of this use. Power plant cooling accounted for 48% of U.S. water withdrawals in 2000 (Hoffman, 59). The generation of hydroelectric power further consumes our fresh water resources.\n\nThe treatment of raw water sources to prevent contamination during storage, distribution and handling further complicates global access to water. While necessary, Water Safety Plans (WSPs) add to the economic investment that’s needed to protect the public health. A total of 884 million people (13% of the global population) lack access to improved water supplies; 1.8 million deaths occur annually from diarrheal disease, hepatitis A, parasites, arsenic poisoning and fluorosis which are all contributable to contaminated water (Pollard, 389). More often than not the upfront investment, availability of staff and cultural barriers make implementing proper WSPs very difficult.\n\nOne option that’s been proposed to help combat contaminated water supplies is point-of-use (POU) water treatment technologies. The current implementations of these systems come in two forms, the BioSand filter (BSF) and the ceramic water filter. The BSF uses a combination of finely and coarsely ground rock to create a slow sand filter. A ceramic water filter is a clay pot with a colloidal silver lining that acts as a biocide. The largest implementation of both filters can be found in Cambodia. Two studies conducted in that country found up to 44 and 46% reduction of diarrheal diseases with the BSF and ceramic filters respectively (Farahbakhsh, 611). While this is far from a perfect solution it is an example of human ingenuity in the face of a growing crisis.\n\nIt has been said that in the coming decades water will become the new oil. While in many respects this may be true, there may be one silver lining to this possibly inevitable crisis. Unlike oil, our global water supplies are partly recycled by our planet. Ground water rises into lakes that flow into the oceans through rivers where it’s picked up by the atmosphere to be dropped back onto and into the ground through rainfall. While the filtering provided through this cycle of precipitation may help in lessening the impact of a coming global shortage of fresh water it is not enough. If we truly want to prevent a breakdown in public health and social advancement we will need global cooperation in managing our fresh water supplies for the good of all the earth’s inhabitants as well as early and heavy investment in water safety plans. Whether or not this outcome will materialize remains to be seen. Our collective history is full of defining moments where we came together as a species to overcome adversity, yet the annals of history are also full of examples when we couldn’t.

The thin line between perceived reality and imagined non-reality is nothing more than a conscious construct necessary to maintain one’s sanity.\n\nAs human beings our perception of reality is a result of the bio-electric processing of the input received by our brains. This fact alone is enough to make any serious discussion of reality suspect. The forward march of our existence is predicated on the realities we perceive in the world around us as well as the ones we imagine in our dreams. Imagination is central to the human experience and is by its very nature rooted in non-reality. In our imaginations and in our dreams is where we play out fantasies that society at large has deemed counter productive, inappropriate or taboo. In addition it’s where we create realities that can be used as test beds or training grounds for future realities that may or may not come into existence.\n\nAt its core, reality is the sum of all actions that have been taken, are being taken now and will be taken in the future by the entirety of humanity. An example of this collective reality is the recent surge in popularity of so-called reality TV. According to The Nielson Company, viewing estimates for broadcast TV during the week of April 18, 2011 the top four rated shows were American Idol – Wednesday (22.5 million), Dancing With The Stars (20 million), American Idol - Thursday (20 million) and Dancing With the Stars Results (16 million). These programs depict “real people” in “real situations”. While this reality may appear at first to be different than the fictional realities portrayed in more traditional programming, it is in fact just a different kind of reality. It is reality created and broadcast in real time as opposed to the imagined reality of more traditional, fictional entertainment. At their most basic level they are still just a processed perception interpreted by our brains. Are the feelings of compassion or contempt for the “stars” of these programs any different than those you feel for your favorite prime-time actor or actress?\n\nIn Tennessee Williams’ 1944 play The Glass Menagerie, the themes of reality vs. non-reality are played out for our collective entertainment. The entire production is staged in the memory of the actor and narrator Tom Winfield. The reality explored in the play is the version of non-reality that exists in Tom’s memories. However what’s most interesting is that while in the version of reality processed by Tom’s memory the audience is additionally exposed to the non-reality of the other two main characters. His mother’s version of reality may be the most striking of the play. The perceived reality that she lives in could never compare with the reality she interpreted as a young woman growing up in the south. Her entire existence is an attempt to recreate as much of that lost reality as possible. Her attempts at securing a “gentleman caller” for her daughter are the apex of her struggle to maintain a non-reality based on the reality of her past. Tom’s sister Laura also strides the gulf between realities. While portrayed as a shy woman struggling with a physical deformity, the actual reality of her condition is left up to the audience. Is her inferiority complex an emotional manifestation of the limp caused by her polio, or is the limp a physical manifestation of her inferiority complex? The answer to that question is woven into the fabric of the reality in which her world is perceived. In the final moments of the play we get a rare glimpse into the convergence of the non-reality existing solely in the memory of the narrator and his current reality as he attempts to reconcile these two separate but equal constructs in an empty apartment where the flames of existence were extinguished long ago.\n\nReality, whether our current perceived reality or the imagined non-reality buried deep in the recesses of our unconscious, shares a tremendous amount in common with the passage of time in that both time and reality are relative to the individual experiencing them. Time can fly while you’re having fun and it can grind to an excruciating halt when you’re not. In much the same way the recollection of reality passed is perceived relative to observer. It is often said that there are three sides to every story - your side, my side and the truth. In The Glass Menagerie, the convergence of perceived reality and imagined non-reality is made glaringly apparent through the dichotomy of Laura’s recollection of high school and her gentleman caller’s recollection of the same time period. For her the imagined non-reality was and is just as real as his yet they couldn’t be more different. What these constructs convey is that as much as we may dislike it, the truth is relative. We can extrapolate from this understanding that the realities that are still to come will be interpreted as they pass, recorded according to their perceived experience and then fall to the annals of history only to once again be recalled in a desperate attempt to give meaning to the reality currently being processed.

There isn’t a living being on this planet that hasn’t been exposed to suffering in some capacity.  You can see it in the faces of your closest friends and relatives, as well as find it’s stain on almost every form of artistic expression. Many outlets have been explored to express and convey these constructs in terms that we can understand, but few provide any comfort or solace. Pain and suffering, whether emotional or physical, are core components in defining who we are as sentient beings.\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition or measurement that can properly quantify suffering. Each of us experiences our lives in different ways and to varying degrees. The one truth that can be agreed upon is that we are all subject to differing emotional states and in turn react differently based upon the situations we encounter. The true role of suffering in our lives is to bring meaning to happiness. Our emotions are complimentary and blend together in order to give the others meaning. They form a pallet of color that extends far beyond the eye’s perception. Yet we can “see” when someone is in pain and most of us can “feel” when someone we are close to is suffering. It is the very intangibility of these ideas that give them their greatest power. But it isn’t until we’ve lived these immense forces do we come to any semblance of understanding their great power over who we are, and more importantly, who we can be.\n\nWhen I was 11 years old my parents sat my brother and me down to try and explain the reasons leading to their separation. When I turned 12 my father sat us both down again to tell us he was moving to California. After I turned 13 I sat with my brother once more as we listened to my Mother tell us that our Father was dead and we would never see him again. I will never forget how that affected me. However, I’ll never be able to know how it truly affected my brother. These experiences, while traumatic, encapsulate a constant reminder that I should cherish any and all fleeting moments of happiness because suffering is always right around the corner. What doesn’t kill us truly does makes us stronger.\n\nSince before recorded history we have strived to understand the world around us. Our inability to explain pain and suffering, as well as happiness and joy, gave rise to the belief in a supreme being that must be responsible for the good and the bad things that happen to us. Otherwise what could possibly be the point? While this belief could be and probably is misguided it has nevertheless served as a blanket protecting us from the cold truth of a world and reality that rarely, if ever makes sense. The entirety of existence marches on around us like the Earth around the Sun flowing constantly from birth to death; whether we choose to accept the inevitability of suffering and pain in our daily lives is directly correlated to the people we are and the person we will become.\n\nIn the story Sonny’s Blues the author James Baldwin explores the depths of suffering through the lives of the citizens of Harlem during the first half of the 20th century. The plot follows two brothers who lead very different lives shaped by their individual experiences with pain and suffering. The older brother, a US Army World War II veteran, carries his suffering around like a medal awarded for bravery that is now a weight tethering him to the darkness that imprisoned his Mother and Father before him. While his younger brother, a Jazz musician and recovering heroin addict locked his suffering away deep inside until it melted away a significant portion of his adult life. Yet a glaring example of the correlated positive force in their shared suffering can clearly be seen in the death of the older brother’s youngest daughter. It was in her death, and her suffering that her Father found the courage to reach out to his younger brother and finally make the connection they both so desperately needed, but could never solidify on their own. In the closing paragraphs of the story, the elder brother joins Sonny at a club to listen, for the first time, to the music upon which his brother pins all of his pain and sorrow. In the melodies of his brother’s pain he understands that listening to our sorrow is how we acknowledge the coming of our eventual happiness and content.\n\n[Jeremy Bentham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham), an English jurist, philosopher, and legal and social reformer, attempted to create a complete utilitarian code of law. According to his 1789 work titled Principles of Morals and Legislation: “Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand the standard of right and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their throne. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think…”. His student [John Stuart Mill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill) later expanded upon his work. Mill built upon the teachings of Bentham to formulate what he called the “greatest happiness principle\". It holds that one must always act so as to produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people, within reason. It is within these ideas that we can clearly see that happiness and joy and pain and suffering are inextricably linked and by ignoring one you ignore them all. And in so doing you are denying what you can be, denying what you are supposed to be.\n\nPain and suffering truly are the core components in defining who we are as members of a universal community so far beyond our comprehension that the very idea shadows the concepts we are constantly trying to grab a hold of. You can see it in our literature and in our art. You can read it on the faces of the good and the faces of the evil. You can feel it in your own soul. It cannot be quantified in ritualistic belief systems. It cannot be escaped because it is inside each and every one of us. Pain and suffering mold the context that brings meaning to our lives.

On the main profile activity the user's avatar is in a 100dp square `ImageView` like this:\n\n    <ImageView\n        android:id=\"@+id/avatar\"\n        android:layout_width=\"100dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"100dp\"\n        android:layout_alignParentTop=\"true\"\n        android:layout_alignParentLeft=\"true\"\n        android:layout_alignParentStart=\"false\"\n        android:contentDescription=\"@string/profile_avatar\"\n        android:layout_marginLeft=\"30dp\"\n        android:layout_marginTop=\"10dp\"\n        android:layout_marginRight=\"10dp\" />\n\nOn other pages where I need to attribute the content to the user that created it I use a smaller 50dp square `ImageView` like this:\n\n    <ImageView\n        android:id=\"@+id/avatar\"\n        android:layout_width=\"50dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"50dp\"\n        android:layout_alignParentTop=\"true\"\n        android:layout_alignParentLeft=\"true\"\n        android:layout_alignParentStart=\"false\"\n        android:contentDescription=\"@string/profile_avatar\"\n        android:layout_margin=\"10dp\" />\n\nAs I said above, I wanted these images to be displayed as circles to differentiate them from other images being displayed in the activity. The problem I ran into was that either the image was too small and would appear in the upper left-hand corner and then stretch the pixels out along the rest of the canvas that UIL is drawing, or the image displayed too large so it appeared as though the circle was cropping out most of my image.\n\nI tried to read the UIL code in `RoundedBitmapDisplayer` but it's still a little over my head. Instead I just kept experimenting with different image sizes until I found the dimensions that fit without a need for UIL to scale inside the canvas.\n\nWhat really saved me is that I am using [Gravatar][1] for my app's avatars. So I can ask Gravatar for whatever size I want by passing query params in the request. Here's what I ended up doing:\n\n1.) I defined a static method on an application class I've been using to collect general util methods. I need this method because I'm getting my Gravatar URLs from my Rails API.\n\n    public static String rebuildAvatarUrl(String url, String size) throws URISyntaxException {\n        URI uri = new URI(url);\n        return \"https://\" + uri.getHost() + uri.getPath() + \"?s=\" + size + \"&d=identicon\";\n    }\n\n2.) I can pass in the URL I get from the `AsyncTask()` that talks to my API and get back a well formed Gravatar URL when loading up my `ProfileActivity`. So in my activity I call this:\n\n        try {\n            String imageUrl = MyApp.rebuildAvatarUrl(prefs.getString(\"avatar_url\", null), \"300\");\n            ImageLoader.getInstance().displayImage(imageUrl, avatarView, MyApp.avatarUILOptions(200));\n        } catch (URISyntaxException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\nNow the trick I figured out is that you need very specific dimensions when asking UIL to draw these circular canvases. Basically it comes down to this:\n\n1. if you want a perfect circle pass a radius to `RoundedBitmapDisplayer` that is **two times** the size of your image. In my example above I pass a radius of 200. This means the image I'm loading is my first example from above. It's the avatar I display on the main `ProfileActivity` for the logged in user on my app.\n\n2. the actual size of the image needs to be **three times** as large as the `ImageView` in which you are going to display it. If you look back at my XML you'll see that I am using a 100dp square `ImageView` so my image needs to be 300px.\n\nFor the sake of completeness here is the second static application class method from above so you can see how I am configuring my UIL DisplayOptions:\n\n    public static DisplayImageOptions avatarUILOptions(int radius) {\n        DisplayImageOptions.Builder options = new DisplayImageOptions.Builder();\n        options.showImageOnLoading(R.drawable.blank_image);\n        options.cacheInMemory(true);\n        options.cacheOnDisc(true);\n        options.displayer(new RoundedBitmapDisplayer(radius, 0));\n        options.bitmapConfig(Bitmap.Config.RGB_565);\n        return options.build();\n    }\n\nI hope this helps someone, I realize that if you are getting images in a fixed size my solution may not help. But if you do have access to an API or service where you can ask for a specific size this could solve your UIL stretch image problems.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://en.gravatar.com","html":"<p>I just ran into a similar issue while trying to display round (circular) profile images in my first Android app. I am also using Universal Image Loader and I display user profile avatars in a few locations right now but they only display <strong>in two different sizes</strong>.

problems.</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2014-04-20T07:02:21.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2014-04-20T07:02:21.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":null,"published_by":null}],"posts_tags":[{"id":2,"post_id":1,"tag_id":2},{"id":3,"post_id":1,"tag_id":3},{"id":4,"post_id":2,"tag_id":4},{"id":5,"post_id":2,"tag_id":5},{"id":6,"post_id":3,"tag_id":4},{"id":7,"post_id":3,"tag_id":5},{"id":8,"post_id":4,"tag_id":4},{"id":9,"post_id":4,"tag_id":5},{"id":10,"post_id":5,"tag_id":4},{"id":11,"post_id":5,"tag_id":5},{"id":12,"post_id":6,"tag_id":4},{"id":13,"post_id":6,"tag_id":5},{"id":14,"post_id":7,"tag_id":4},{"id":15,"post_id":7,"tag_id":5},{"id":16,"post_id":8,"tag_id":6},{"id":17,"post_id":8,"tag_id":7},{"id":18,"post_id":9,"tag_id":8},{"id":19,"post_id":11,"tag_id":8},{"id":20,"post_id":12,"tag_id":8},{"id":21,"post_id":14,"tag_id":4},{"id":22,"post_id":14,"tag_id":5},{"id":23,"post_id":15,"tag_id":5},{"id":24,"post_id":16,"tag_id":5},{"id":26,"post_id":18,"tag_id":5},{"id":28,"post_id":20,"tag_id":9},{"id":29,"post_id":21,"tag_id":9},{"id":30,"post_id":22,"tag_id":9},{"id":31,"post_id":23,"tag_id":9},{"id":32,"post_id":24,"tag_id":9},{"id":33,"post_id":25,"tag_id":9},{"id":134,"post_id":122,"tag_id":9},{"id":135,"post_id":123,"tag_id":9},{"id":136,"post_id":124,"tag_id":9},{"id":137,"post_id":125,"tag_id":9},{"id":138,"post_id":126,"tag_id":9},{"id":139,"post_id":127,"tag_id":9},{"id":140,"post_id":128,"tag_id":9},{"id":141,"post_id":129,"tag_id":9},{"id":142,"post_id":130,"tag_id":9},{"id":143,"post_id":131,"tag_id":9},{"id":144,"post_id":132,"tag_id":9},{"id":145,"post_id":134,"tag_id":9},{"id":146,"post_id":135,"tag_id":9},{"id":147,"post_id":136,"tag_id":9},{"id":148,"post_id":137,"tag_id":9},{"id":149,"post_id":138,"tag_id":9},{"id":150,"post_id":139,"tag_id":9},{"id":151,"post_id":140,"tag_id":9},{"id":152,"post_id":141,"tag_id":9},{"id":153,"post_id":142,"tag_id":9},{"id":154,"post_id":143,"tag_id":9},{"id":155,"post_id":144,"tag_id":9},{"id":156,"post_id":145,"tag_id":9},{"id":157,"post_id":146,"tag_id":9},{"id":158,"post_id":147,"tag_id":9},{"id":159,"post_id":148,"tag_id":9},{"id":160,"post_id":149,"tag_id":9},{"id":161,"post_id":150,"tag_id":9},{"id":162,"post_id":151,"tag_id":9},{"id":163,"post_id":152,"tag_id":9},{"id":164,"post_id":153,"tag_id":9},{"id":165,"post_id":154,"tag_id":9},{"id":166,"post_id":155,"tag_id":9},{"id":167,"post_id":156,"tag_id":9},{"id":168,"post_id":157,"tag_id":9},{"id":169,"post_id":158,"tag_id":9},{"id":170,"post_id":159,"tag_id":9},{"id":171,"post_id":160,"tag_id":9},{"id":172,"post_id":161,"tag_id":9},{"id":173,"post_id":162,"tag_id":9},{"id":174,"post_id":163,"tag_id":9},{"id":175,"post_id":164,"tag_id":9},{"id":176,"post_id":165,"tag_id":9},{"id":177,"post_id":166,"tag_id":9},{"id":178,"post_id":167,"tag_id":9},{"id":179,"post_id":168,"tag_id":9},{"id":180,"post_id":169,"tag_id":9},{"id":181,"post_id":171,"tag_id":2},{"id":182,"post_id":171,"tag_id":104}],"roles":[{"id":1,"uuid":"5995f126-2e54-464b-b444-1f84a8c59d74","name":"Administrator","description":"Administrators","created_at":"2013-11-12T19:07:17.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2013-11-12T19:07:17.000Z","updated_by":1},{"id":2,"uuid":"0c36fa70-a984-42f1-a480-651b6f451d0a","name":"Editor","description":"Editors","created_at":"2013-11-12T19:07:17.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2013-11-12T19:07:17.000Z","updated_by":1},{"id":3,"uuid":"7c882d69-8822-472d-8b9d-aa8e67f5d9d5","name":"Author","description":"Authors","created_at":"2013-11-12T19:07:17.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2013-11-12T19:07:17.000Z","updated_by":1},{"id":4,"uuid":"59dbacf1-83b7-48a9-982e-5b4f56bd40bb","name":"Owner","description":"Blog
